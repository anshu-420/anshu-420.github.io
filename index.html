      <p style="position:relative; left:250px; font-family: 'Mulish', verdana;">

      Some of my <b>hobbies and pastimes</b> are related to some of my interests in <em>STEM.</em> Other than that
      I love playing<br>& watching sports and spending time with my <em>family and friends</em>. My main passion is
      <b>cooking</b>, as I believe that<br>food brings people together. These are some of things I do, when I'm not studying or
      focusing on school. <b>Travelling</b> <br>and learning about other cultures is something I love to do with my family.
